## Overview
This Bash script automates the setup and configuration of a Debian 13 GNOME system. It handles system updates, installs essential packages, configures applications, sets up a firewall, and organizes directories for a secure and efficient environment. The script is designed to streamline the process of setting up a new Debian 13 GNOME installation with privacy and productivity tools.

Package Installation: Installs a curated set of tools and applications, including:
Base tools: curl, neovim, wget, rsync, zip, git, zsh, terminator, ffmpeg, ufw, vlc, gimp, keepassxc, and more.
